## Protecting Your macOS Against Malware

Apple employs a comprehensive threat intelligence process to promptly identify and block malware, ensuring your macOS stays secure. This post will outline the three layers of malware defense that Apple has implemented to safeguard your device:

1. Preventing malware distribution and execution
2. Blocking malware from running on user systems
3. Remediating executed malware

### Layer 1: Inhibiting Malware Distribution and Execution

The first layer of defense aims to restrict malware distribution and prevent it from launching even once. This is achieved through the App Store, Gatekeeper, and Notarization.

### Layer 2: Identifying and Blocking Malware on Mac Systems

The second layer of defense is designed to quickly identify and block malware on any Mac, to prevent further spread and remedy affected systems. This layer is strengthened by XProtect, in addition to Gatekeeper and Notarization.

### Layer 3: Remediating Executed Malware

Lastly, XProtect works to remediate any malware that has successfully executed, ensuring the safety and integrity of your macOS.

Together, these defenses provide comprehensive protection from viruses and malware.

## Notarization: Apple's Malware Scanning Service

Notarization is a malware scanning service provided by Apple for developers distributing apps outside the App Store. Developers submit their apps for scanning as part of the distribution process, and if no malware is detected, Apple issues a Notarization ticket. Developers then "staple" the ticket to their app, allowing Gatekeeper to verify and launch the app even offline.

Apple can revoke Notarization tickets for malicious apps, ensuring that Gatekeeper has the latest information to block such files. This process can quickly block malicious apps since updates occur more frequently than background updates that push new XProtect signatures.

## XProtect: macOS Built-in Antivirus Technology

XProtect is a built-in antivirus technology in macOS for signature-based detection and removal of malware. Using YARA signatures, XProtect receives regular updates from Apple to defend against new malware infections and strains. XProtect automatically detects and blocks the execution of known malware.

In macOS 10.15 or later, XProtect checks for malicious content under the following conditions:

- An app is first launched
- An app has been changed (in the file system)
- XProtect signatures are updated

If XProtect detects known malware, the software is blocked, and the user is notified with the option to move the software to the Trash.

XProtect also includes technology to remediate infections, such as the XProtect Remediator, introduced in macOS Monterey 12.3 on March 14, 2022. This feature is updated frequently, approximately every couple of weeks. As a collection of background scanning modules, XProtect Remediator discreetly completes its tasks without posting notifications.

XProtect Remediator is fully compatible with macOS Catalina, Big Sur, and Monterey. However, accessing its scan results in these operating systems is only possible through the Unified log. Ventura offers an alternative by making the results available as Endpoint Security events, which can be monitored by third-party security systems. Nonetheless, the only security software currently capable of capturing scans via Endpoint Security is geared towards and priced for enterprise users.

## Automatic XProtect Security Updates

Apple issues XProtect updates automatically based on the latest threat intelligence available. By default, macOS checks for these updates daily, while Notarization updates, distributed via CloudKit sync, are even more frequent.

## Apple's Response to New Malware Discoveries

When new malware is discovered, Apple might take several actions:

- Revoke associated Developer ID certificates
- Issue Notarization revocation tickets for all files (apps and associated files)
- Develop and release XProtect signatures

These signatures are also applied retroactively to previously notarized software, and any new detections can trigger further actions to provide the best possible protection to macOS users.
