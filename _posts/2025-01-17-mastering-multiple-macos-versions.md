Managing multiple versions of macOS on a single Mac is a challenge many enthusiasts and researchers face. Whether you’re a developer, security researcher, or tech enthusiast, understanding the nuances of dual-booting, external disks, and virtualization can open up new possibilities. Let’s dive into the best strategies for running multiple macOS versions, with a focus on Apple silicon Macs.

## The Basics: Why Multiple macOS Versions?

From testing beta features to running legacy software, there are plenty of reasons to manage multiple macOS installations. However, Apple’s modern macOS architecture, especially on Apple silicon Macs, introduces challenges:

- **Compatibility**: Macs can only boot versions of macOS as new as the version they shipped with.
- **Secure Boot and APFS**: Modern storage and boot systems are intricate, requiring precise management of boot volume groups.

## Option 1: Dual Booting on Internal SSD

Dual booting involves installing multiple macOS versions on the internal SSD, each with its own boot volume group.

### **Steps to Set Up Dual Boot**
1. **Prepare Space**:
   - Use Disk Utility to create a new APFS volume.
   - Allocate sufficient storage for the new macOS version.

2. **Install macOS**:
   - Download the desired macOS installer.
   - Select the new APFS volume during installation.

3. **Switch Between Versions**:
   - Use Startup Disk in System Settings or press and hold the Power key until "Loading startup options" appears on the screen for Macs with Apple silicon.

### **Pros and Cons**
- **Pros**: High performance, shared APFS space, and hardware-level encryption.
- **Cons**: Complex management of recovery and preboot volumes.

## Option 2: Bootable External Disk

If you prefer simplicity, an external disk is a great choice for running another macOS version.

### **Setup Process**
1. Format the external drive as **APFS**.
2. Install macOS directly onto the external drive.
3. Boot by pressing and holding the Power key until "Loading startup options" appears, then select the external disk for Macs with Apple silicon.

### **Advantages**
- Keeps internal storage clean.
- Portable between multiple Macs.

### **Drawbacks**
- Slower than internal SSDs.
- Lacks hardware FileVault encryption.

## Option 3: Virtual Machines (VMs)

Virtualization is the safest and most flexible option for running multiple macOS versions.

### **Why Choose VMs?**
- **Isolation**: Problems in the VM won’t affect the host system.
- **Flexibility**: Run multiple macOS versions simultaneously.
- **Safety**: No changes to physical storage.

### **Setup**
1. Choose virtualization software: **Parallels Desktop**, **VMware Fusion**, or **UTM** (open source).
2. Use a macOS installer to create the virtual machine.
3. Configure resources (RAM, CPU, storage) for optimal performance.

### **Limitations**
- macOS VMs on Apple silicon can’t run versions earlier than Monterey.
- iCloud and App Store apps may have limited functionality.

## Choosing the Right Method

| **Scenario**                         | **Best Option**         |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Need high performance               | Dual Boot (Internal SSD)|
| Prefer simplicity and portability   | External Disk          |
| Testing or multi-tasking            | Virtual Machines       |

## Final Thoughts

Running multiple macOS versions is both an art and a science, especially with Apple silicon’s secure boot features. For the fastest and most reliable experience, internal SSD dual booting is the way to go. However, for safety and flexibility, virtualization remains unbeatable. 

Whether you’re experimenting with beta features or diving into legacy software, these methods ensure you can explore macOS to its fullest potential.
