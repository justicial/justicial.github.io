categories: Security
---

## **Introduction**

In macOS, file rename operations can present vulnerabilities, especially when applications utilize temporary files before renaming them to their final destinations. An attacker, by exploiting precise timing, can redirect these operations to gain control over sensitive files.

A notable example is **CVE-2023-32407**, where the **Metal framework** was exploited to overwrite `TCC.db`, allowing unauthorized modifications to macOS security permissions. Although this specific vulnerability has been addressed, the underlying **rename race condition** remains a potential threat.

This post delves into the mechanics of **rename-based exploits**, explores their applicability beyond the Metal framework, and provides guidance for researchers aiming to identify applications that might still be susceptible.

## **Understanding the Rename Race Condition in macOS**

### **How Rename Operations Work**

macOS provides functions like **`rename()` and `renameatx_np()`** for file modifications. A critical aspect of these operations is that they **resolve the source (`old`) and destination (`new`) paths separately** before executing the rename. This behavior introduces a **race condition**, where an attacker can **alter directories or files between resolution and execution** to misdirect the operation.

### **Why Rename Operations Are Exploitable**

1. **Temporary File Usage**:
   - Many applications, including system daemons, **write temporary files before renaming them** to ensure atomic updates.
   - This practice creates a **brief window of opportunity** where an attacker can **intervene before the rename is finalized**.

2. **Non-Atomic Path Resolution**:
   - The `rename()` function resolves both the source and destination **before executing the operation**.
   - If an attacker **modifies the source or destination directory** during this resolution, the final rename **can be redirected**.

3. **Delayed Permission Enforcement**:
   - macOS **applies permissions after a rename completes**, meaning that **a hijacked rename could result in unauthorized access** to sensitive files.

## **From CVE-2023-32407 to Generalized Exploits**

Apple addressed **CVE-2023-32407** by removing the **Metal debugging functionality** that permitted controlled file writes. However, **rename-based exploits remain feasible** if an application or system process follows similar **temporary file and rename patterns**.

### **Expanding Beyond Metal: Identifying New Rename Targets**

Researchers can identify new vulnerable applications by:

1. **Monitoring Rename System Calls in Real-Time**:
   ```sh
   sudo fs_usage -w | grep rename
   ```
   - Identifies **applications frequently performing rename operations**.
   - Highlights **potential writable directories** where swaps could be executed.

2. **Utilizing DTrace for Rename Syscalls**:
   ```sh
   sudo dtrace -n 'syscall::rename*:entry { printf("%s renames %s -> %s", execname, copyinstr(arg0), copyinstr(arg1)); }'
   ```
   - Logs all **rename operations** system-wide.
   - Helps **identify applications** that rename files from **writable locations to protected directories**.

3. **Analyzing iCloud and App Data Sync Behavior**:
   - iCloud synchronizes temporary files before renaming them.
   - Some applications with **Full Disk Access (FDA)** may rename files within **sensitive locations**.

## **Developing a Generalized Rename Exploit Framework**

With a list of **potential rename targets**, the next step is to develop a **generalized switcher** to hijack rename operations.

### **Core Components of the Exploit Framework**

1. **Detect and Track Temporary File Creation**:
   - Employ **a tight `while` loop** instead of slower APIs (`kqueue()`, `FSEvents`), ensuring **precise execution timing**.

2. **Automate Directory Swaps Using `renameatx_np()`**:
   ```c
   renameatx_np(AT_FDCWD, "/Users/attacker/tmp",
                AT_FDCWD, "/Users/attacker/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/", RENAME_SWAP);
   ```
   - Ensures **atomic directory swaps** before the application completes its rename.

3. **Reopen and Modify the Renamed File**:
   - Many applications keep file descriptors **open to the old inode**, so reopening the renamed file ensures full control.

## **Challenges & Future Research**

Apple is continuously enhancing macOS security, making **rename-based attacks more challenging**. However, **potential vulnerabilities remain**:

1. **APFS Journaling & Snapshot Rollback**:
   - If a renamed file is immediately snapshotted, **Apple may auto-revert modifications**, thwarting exploitation.

2. **Real-Time Permission Enforcement**:
   - If macOS starts enforcing **real-time permission checks on renames**, swapping temporary files might no longer be effective.

3. **TCC and SIP Protections on System Daemons**:
   - Apple could further **restrict system processes from renaming sensitive files**.

### **Next Steps for Researchers**

- **Test on different macOS versions** to observe if `RENAME_SWAP` behavior changes.
- **Investigate applications with extensive entitlements** that perform rename operations.
- **Examine how APFS snapshots track renamed files**.

## **Conclusion**

By combining **rename tracking, automated directory swapping, and stealth techniques**, researchers can continue **exploring macOS file system weaknesses**, ensuring both **stronger security** and **innovative exploit development**. üöÄ
