## Introduction

For security researchers in the Apple ecosystem, the **Apple Security Bounty (ASB) program** remains both an opportunity and a challenge. While Apple pays **significant bounties**, researchers often encounter **long patch timelines, inconsistent report processing, and silent fixes**. Drawing from **firsthand experiences**, this post explores the nuances of **navigating Apple‚Äôs bug bounty program**, offering insights into payout structures, best reporting practices, and the ethical dilemma of staggered vulnerability submissions.

## The Reality of Apple‚Äôs Bounty Payouts

Apple‚Äôs bounty program is **among the highest-paying** in the industry, with macOS bounties often exceeding payouts from **other OEMs**. However, it has some key limitations:

- **macOS bounties are lower than iOS** payouts and often do not reach the maximum amounts listed in Apple‚Äôs public guidelines.
- Even **low-severity vulnerabilities** can receive **significant payouts** if they expose user data.
- The **minimum bounty is $5,000**, which can still be higher than a critical vulnerability in another vendor‚Äôs program.
- If a vulnerability doesn‚Äôt fall into Apple‚Äôs predefined categories, **they may not pay a bounty at all**.

### **Comparing ASB to Other Platforms**

| **Platform** | **Typical Bounty Range** |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Apple (macOS)** | $5,000 ‚Äì $100,000+ |
| **Apple (iOS)** | Higher payouts than macOS |
| **Google** | Competitive, but varies per bug |
| **Microsoft** | Focuses on Windows security, high for critical bugs |
| **Web3/Blockchain** | Some programs exceed Apple‚Äôs payouts |

## The Bug Bounty Confirmation Process: Fast vs. Slow

One of the **biggest challenges** with ASB is the **inconsistency in response times**:

- Some vulnerabilities are **confirmed immediately**, sometimes even the same day a CVE is published.
- Others **take months (or over a year) to confirm**, even after Apple has released a patch.
- **Re-evaluations** (when a researcher disputes the bounty decision) can take **months**.
- **Once confirmed, payments are processed quickly** (usually within a month).

### **What Causes Delays?**
- **Regression Concerns:** Apple delays some fixes to prevent breaking other features.
- **Internal Prioritization:** iOS vulnerabilities receive more attention than macOS.
- **Multiple Reports:** If multiple researchers submit the same bug, Apple may take longer to assess its impact.

---

## The Ethical Dilemma: Staggered vs. Full Disclosure

One controversial strategy in the ASB program is **how to submit vulnerabilities**:

- **Submitting multiple related vulnerabilities separately** can result in **higher payouts** because Apple patches each one individually.
- If **all vulnerabilities are submitted at once**, Apple may **refactor the affected code**, fixing multiple issues with a single patch and **reducing the total bounty amount**.
- However, this strategy **delays full fixes**, leaving users exposed longer.

### **Should Apple Change Its Approach?**
Some vendors **offer higher payouts** for attack chains or full-scope disclosures, encouraging researchers to submit **everything at once**. Apple does not currently do this, which **incentivizes staggered submissions**.

## Silent Patches: The Frustration of Uncredited Fixes

A major concern for researchers is **silent patching**‚Äîwhere Apple fixes a reported vulnerability without credit or bounty payment.

### **Case Study: SIP-Bypass Vulnerability**
- A researcher submitted a **persistence vulnerability** in a **SIP-protected area**.
- Apple **modified the report status multiple times** before eventually closing it, stating that **EDR tools could mitigate the risk**.
- **Two months later**, a new discovery revealed that Apple had **silently patched the issue in macOS 15.0 beta**‚Äîwithout acknowledging or paying the researcher.

### **Apple‚Äôs Report Status Can Change Unexpectedly**
- If Apple marks a fix as **‚ÄúSpring 2025‚Äù**, it does **not guarantee** that the vulnerability will be patched then.
- Apple **can modify report status at any time**, leaving researchers uncertain about their findings.

## The Future of macOS Bug Hunting: What‚Äôs Next?

The Apple Security Bounty program remains **one of the most financially rewarding**, yet **inconsistent**, options for security researchers. The challenges of **delayed patches, silent fixes, and unpredictable payouts** make it difficult to navigate. However, the opportunity remains vast, and **as macOS security evolves, so do the potential attack surfaces**.

### **Key Takeaways**
‚úî **Expect delayed responses but fast payments once confirmed.**

‚úî **macOS bounties are lower than iOS, but still among the highest in the industry.**

‚úî **Submitting vulnerabilities separately can result in higher payouts.**

‚úî **Silent patches remain a challenge for researchers seeking proper credit.**

‚úî **Apple should consider revising its payout structure to encourage full attack chain submissions.**

üöÄ **As security researchers, we must adapt to Apple‚Äôs evolving approach while advocating for more transparency and fairness in the bounty process.**
