On May 1st, 2023, Apple released its first Rapid Security Response (RSR) update to the public, targeting iOS 16.4.1, iPadOS 16.4.1, and macOS 13.3.1 Ventura. This update not only upgrades macOS to version 13.3.1 (22E772610a) but also updates Safari to version 16.4 (18615.1.26.110.1). Although a restart is required to finalize the installation, it takes only a slightly longer time than a standard reboot.

### Rapid Security Responses: Strengthening Security for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS

RSRs aim to provide crucial security enhancements between regular software updates, ensuring a safer experience for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users. These cutting-edge releases tackle essential security improvements, such as updates to the Safari web browser, the WebKit framework stack, and other critical system libraries. Moreover, RSRs swiftly address specific security issues, including those exploited or reported to exist "in the wild."

Apple exclusively offers RSRs for the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS—beginning with iOS 16.4.1, iPadOS 16.4.1, and macOS 13.3.1.

By default, your device is set to automatically apply RSRs and, if necessary, prompt you to restart your device. To confirm your device settings:

**iPhone or iPad:** Go to Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates, and ensure "Security Responses & System Files" is enabled.

**Mac:** Click the Apple menu  > System Settings, then select General in the sidebar and Software Update on the right. Click the Show Details button next to Automatic Updates and make sure "Install Security Responses and system files" is enabled.

Once an RSR is applied, a letter appears next to the software version number, for example: macOS 13.3.1 (a).

If you opt to disable this setting or choose not to apply RSRs when they are available, your device will receive the relevant fixes or mitigations in the subsequent software update.
