When it comes to safeguarding your data, Apple's macOS offers robust tools to ensure local storage remains secure. Two key technologies, **FileVault** and **APFS Encrypted Volumes**, are at the forefront of this effort. While they might seem similar, they have distinct functionalities and use cases, especially on Macs with T2 or Apple silicon chips. Let's explore the nuances of these technologies and how they work to keep your data safe.

## FileVault: Whole-Volume Encryption

FileVault is macOS's built-in solution for encrypting the entire **Data volume** of your boot disk. Accessible through the **Privacy & Security** settings, FileVault ensures that all data is encrypted using hardware-backed keys on Macs with T2 or Apple silicon chips. Here’s how it works:

- **Instant Enablement**: On supported Macs, enabling FileVault is nearly instantaneous because the Data volume is already encrypted. The process involves protecting the **Volume Encryption Key (VEK)** with a **Key Encryption Key (KEK)**, which is secured by your password.
- **Recovery Options**: You can choose between a Recovery Key or iCloud recovery to regain access if you forget your password.
- **Legacy and External Drives**: On Intel Macs without a T2 chip or for external drives, encryption must be performed manually. For the best performance, enable FileVault on freshly created volumes.

## APFS Encrypted Volumes: Versatile and Granular

For non-boot volumes, **APFS Encrypted Volumes** provide a flexible encryption solution. These volumes can be created with encryption enabled from the start or retrofitted with encryption later. Here are the highlights:

- **Creation**: Opt for the APFS Encrypted format during volume creation in Disk Utility for instant encryption.
- **Contextual Commands**: Existing volumes can be encrypted using the Finder’s **Encrypt** command, though this option may not appear in all setups. For comprehensive control, use **Disk Utility** to manage encryption settings.
- **Key Management**: APFS uses **keybags** to store encryption keys, enabling seamless password changes without re-encrypting data. These keys are wrapped using the AES Key Wrap Specification (RFC 3394), ensuring high security.

## The Role of Secure Enclave

On Macs with T2 or Apple silicon chips, the Secure Enclave plays a critical role in encryption. It acts as a gatekeeper, performing encryption and decryption at hardware speeds and managing keys securely. For example:

- Data on the internal SSD flows through the Secure Enclave, ensuring encryption is always active.
- FileVault-protected volumes can only be unlocked using the Secure Enclave of the same Mac, offering unparalleled protection against unauthorized access.

## Practical Applications

Most users will encounter FileVault and APFS encryption in the following scenarios:

1. **System Boot Disk**: FileVault protects the Data volume, managed through Privacy & Security settings.
2. **External Storage**: APFS Encrypted Volumes safeguard sensitive data on external drives, including Time Machine backups.

## Key Takeaways

Both FileVault and APFS Encrypted Volumes are powerful tools in macOS's security arsenal, designed to meet different needs:

- Use **FileVault** for whole-volume encryption of your Mac's boot disk, especially if you rely on the hardware advantages of T2 or Apple silicon chips.
- Opt for **APFS Encrypted Volumes** for granular encryption of external or non-boot volumes.

By leveraging these technologies, macOS users can enjoy a highly secure environment, where data privacy is not just a feature but a standard.
